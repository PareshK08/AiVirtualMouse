# Virtual Mouse
Our solution is a 'Visual Mouse' system that employs a webcam to capture the user's hand movements.
MediaPipe's hand tracking capabilities identify key hand landmarks, which are then processed using OpenCV to determine the hand's position and gestures.
Autopy is used to translate these movements into precise cursor actions.
The system is designed to be user-friendly, requiring minimal setup and offering a seamless, hands-free computing experience
